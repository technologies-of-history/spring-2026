This blog features the research of students in HIST 30693, Technologies of History from Cuneiform to Coding, taught at Texas Christian University in Spring 2026. Throughout the semester, students will be posting their work related to the history of communications technologies from the ancient world to the present day, using various digital "tools" that they learn over the semester. Through these posts, students will learn the basics of GitHub workflows and Markdown language, IIIF manifests, XML and TEI, basic GIS, and network analysis. Sharing their work on this site allows them to take advantage of the possibilities of digital storytelling and digital analytical methodologies. Read on to see what they're working on! 

This is a test to try out a pull request.
