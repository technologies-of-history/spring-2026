  Course Description
  #

This course has two interconnected aims: to introduce students to the history of communications
technology from the ancient Near East to the modern U.S. and to interrogate how contemporary
digital communications technology shapes our study of the past. In this course, we will ask
how the ways we communicate—via inscription, graffito, letter, or blog post—have the power
to affect our society and make history. In addition, this course will introduce students to
new digital methods of historical research and archival preservation, positioning the advent
of the “digital” as just the latest in a series of communications “revolutions”—from the
invention of writing to coming of the press, for example—which have similarly transformed
how contemporaries understood the creation, circulation, and transmission of knowledge.">

<p>This course has two interconnected aims: to introduce students to the history of communications
technology from the ancient Near East to the modern U.S. and to interrogate how contemporary
digital communications technology shapes our study of the past. In this course, we will ask
how the ways we communicate—via inscription, graffito, letter, or blog post—have the power
to affect our society and make history. In addition, this course will introduce students to
new digital methods of historical research and archival preservation, positioning the advent
of the “digital” as just the latest in a series of communications “revolutions”—from the
invention of writing to coming of the press, for example—which have similarly transformed
how contemporaries understood the creation, circulation, and transmission of knowledge.</p>
<p>The digital component of this course thus serves multiple purposes: first, close engagement
with digital archives will allow students to view and appreciate the material texts of the
past; second, students will analyze how digital archives make historical arguments through
the representation and presentation of sources; third, students will become aware of the
limitations of digital archives, both as representations of material objects and as
ephemeral—and often fragile—sources in their own right; and finally, students will develop
frameworks for analyzing digital archives in light of course readings on the nature, function,
and impact of different forms of communication.</p>
<p><strong>Course Learning Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>By the end of the semester, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build historical knowledge:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Identify the most significant trends and figures within the history of the communications technology.</li>
<li>Connect and synthesize historical examples to develop conclusions about the nature, causes, and consequences of communications “revolutions.”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Develop digital historical methods:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate evidence from primary sources as presented in various digital archives.</li>
<li>Recognize archives as an interpretive presentation of evidence from the human past, created by historians and archivists in the present.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Apply digital historical skills:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Use digital tools to analyze primary sources and communicate historical knowledge.</li>

</ul>

  <strong>Course Meetings</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#__course-meetings__">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our course will meet twice per week: Tuesdays will begin with a short lecture, followed by
discussion of secondary scholarship; Thursdays are our “digital lab” days, in which we will
learn about a particular digital tool and explore its applicability for presenting historical
knowledge to a wider public.</p>

<p>My preferred method of contact is email: <a href="mailto:m.reynolds1@tcu.edu">m.reynolds1(at)tcu.edu</a>.
I will do my best to return emails received M-F within 24 hours; emails received after 6 pm
on Fridays may not receive a response until Monday morning.</p>
<p>Students are also welcome to discuss our course in office hours (MW, 11:00 am to noon), or
to schedule an appointment outside of those times.</p>
