<li>Visit the <a href="https://cdli.ucla.edu/">Cuneiform Digital Library</a> and view a cuneiform tablet from any one of the digitized tablets accessible on the site. A good way to find a tablet that’s been translated is to run a “Full Search” and type a single word into the “Translation” search box. Use your imagination to think about what sorts of words or terms might be preserved on a cuneiform tablet.</li>
<li>Visit <a href="https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/">Machine Translation and Automated Analyses of Cuneiform Languages</a> and read their About page. Think about what it means to make a computer read ‘human’ languages, and what it means for humans to try to ‘read’ computer languages.</li>
