Honestly, I've been looking at this inscription for a while, trying to figure out what it says, but I still don't fully understand it. The lettering of this inscription is very clean and well-organized, making it easy to read for those who understand Latin. With the information given about this inscription, I know it was found in ancient Cemenelum, in the Roman province of Alpes Maritimae (modern find spot:
Nice, Cimiez. I also found that this inscription is listed in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL: 05, 07904). Looking closely, the letters are so neatly carved, deep and evenly spaced, making me think someone very good at writing wrote this. From our lesson in class and from reading part of The Cambridge manual of Latin epigraphy by Cooley, these inscriptions were usually meant for the public and placed in public settings for others to read. This inscription probably has something meaningful on it that isn't meant to be hidden or kept secret.

When looking at where other inscriptions have been found in Roman times, I realized they are literally everywhere. I found this super interesting because they showed up even very far from Rome. This shows how much the Romans really cared about writing things down and keeping the history for years to come. Writing their names and achievements in stone makes them last much longer and be more permanent than a piece of paper in our world today. This really shows that this was something they did often; it was in their practice and tied to Roman identity.
