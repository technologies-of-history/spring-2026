# Development of Digital Media 
As humans have evolved over time the more langauge is devolped and the smarter humans have become. Even nurses and doctors from 20 years ago say that school is harder now then it was back in their day. With evolution comes discoveries, everyday humans are discoverying something new and that makes the world such a cool place. What makes language possible is discoveries, with everything new thing found there has to be a new way to describe it. Innovation and techonology make language the way it was today and in the future new words will come around from innvations made today.

Goody and Watt agrue that the differnce between literate and nonliterate is not as extreme as it previously thought according to historians. (Goody and Watt, 321) Oral Communication could actually be more abstract and thoughtful since there was nothing that can be contained within verbal sounds. I agree with this because tone can be everything in a communication. Tone can add new and different dimensions to a conversions that were not there to begin with. Van De Mieroop agrues that in Mesopotamian History was able to created thier own thoughts and history due ot thier freedoms in symbols (Van De Mieroop, 30). Writing was creative and not put into a box much like a 25 symbol alphebet puts you in. The agrument made by these articles shows that Greek philosophical thought and Mesopotamia thought proves that it is not so different after all. Just because it's harder to understand the Mesopotamian symbols does not make then any less smart but just different then what we are used to.
