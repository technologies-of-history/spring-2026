# Writing and technology

![Babylonian Kudurru Tablet](https://cdli.earth/dl/photo/P257300_d.jpg)


Goody argues that writing fundamentally alters cognitive processes by enabling abstraction, classification, and critical reflection. Lists, tables, and written records allow knowledge to be decontextualized and reorganized in ways that oral cultures cannot sustain as easily (Goody 75). Writing makes it possible to compare, revise, and systematize ideas across time and space. In this sense, literacy is not merely a neutral recording device but a “technology of the intellect” that restructures reasoning itself (Goody 19).

Van De Mieroop, particularly in A History of the Ancient Near East, approaches writing less as a cognitive revolution and more as a social and political instrument. He shows how early writing in Mesopotamia developed primarily for administrative and economic purposes—tracking goods, labor, and taxation ( Mieroop 34). Writing was embedded in institutions of power and bureaucracy. Literacy was restricted, and control over writing meant control over economic and political authority. Rather than democratizing knowledge.
