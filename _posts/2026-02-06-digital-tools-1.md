#Analysis 
As language shifts from cunieform to alphabetic writing, this change suggests that the physical structure of language is directly responsible for the way in which its speakers communicate. As the boundaries of communication expand, humans are able to convey conversely more complex ideas and thoughts. The shift from Mesopotamian cuneiform towards the Grecian alphabet asserts more logical shift to define abstract concepts.
