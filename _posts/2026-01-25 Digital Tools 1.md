# The Structures of Language
There are many components involved when you break down a language. Each language is unique in it's orgin, meaning, and writing style but one thing is true for all 
languages and that is they evolve over time. The evolution of language brings social, cultural, and cognitive change. But with so many different languages it can 
be hard to pinpoint what language inspired another. This has led to many historians debating the involvement of alphabetic writing within various developments like 
Greek philosphy.


  With the debate of whether alphabetic writing enabled the development of Greek philosphy I was able to analyze and compare two main arguments. Upon reading the first argument within 
_The Consequences of Literacy_ I inferred the adoption of alphabetic writing helped shift several cognitive and social changes that weren't present when 
society was only oral. An oral society often relied on story telling or things being true because that's what was told to you. The introduction of literacy 
and its success into a society allowed for contradictions and the development of one's own critical thoughts. Without literacy there is no contradiction when comparing
the past and the present (Goody & Watt, 311). This sheds light on to how Greek philosophy was able to develop, because society was finally able to challenge what they 
had been told. 


  While this argument is strong, several historians feel long before the Greeks other societies had already introduced literacy. After reading one historians argument 
outlined within _Philosophy before the Greeks: The Pursuit of Truth in Ancient Babylonia_ I inferred that philosophy actually started with ancient Babaloynia who 
introduced literacy through cuneiform tablets (see Figure 1).

The ancient Babyloanian society was founded around 1200 years before Greek society showing they were the first to establish literacy between the two. Unlike the Greeks who were 
first oral and then shifted to literacy ancient Babyloanians were first literate through cuneiform tablets. These tablets have existed for thousands of years and cover
so many areas of human life and thought (Mieroop, 12). Babyloanians were also able to understand the use of syllables and words simply through the use of signs (Mieroop, 6). 
This shows how although this society wasn't devleoped the exact same way as the Greeks the way they implemented alphabetic writings inspired the Greeks within their own 
philosophical developments.

Both of these arguments show that language does not rely on one structure. Some languages started orally with others using text from the very beginning. Nonetheless they all 
inspire and borrow from each other. Even today with [computer languages](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/programming-and-human-languages) like Java and Python which still use 
human language and math principles. In conclusion no matter what form of literacy a society introduced it was still beneficial in developing philosophy between many societies.
