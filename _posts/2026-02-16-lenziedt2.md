## Ancient Roman Inscriptions: What Can they Tell Us?

Ancient Romans loved to write stuff down. They etched into stone countless decrees, transactions, laws, and more, because that was the tradition of the time. But, what can they really tell us about the ways of life, the things that were held important, or were they just a tool of the elite to keep everyone in line?

The inscription I chose hails from Crete, a medium-sized island south of modern-day Italy, that was a hotbed for Greek and Roman activity.

From the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, there seems to be a rough transcription of the text that was etched into the stone. When run through an Ancient Latin translator, the translation comes out to the following:

Emperor Domitan
Caesar Augustus Germanicus, tenth consul
between the colony Flavia Augusta Felice
Capua and Plotius Plebeius 
by the decision of Emperor Titus Augustus also 
According to the decree of the colony of Capua 
by agreement of both
The boundaries of the party have been set.
under the direction of Publius Messius Campanus
the procurator of Caesar.

The letters that are present in the etching are etched very deeply into the stone, and are relatively easy to make out overall. Because of this, this script seems to be translated correctly, and reads as if the borders of the Roman camps were redrawn and agreed upon, based on the Emperor’s orders. 

Truly, I’m surprised that this type of stone has last as long as it has. There are a handful of other inscriptions that are also found in the same area from similar time periods, though the inscription specifically that I chose does not have a date. It was photographed in 1993 initially, and the high-resolution image lends a lot to the processing and fills in some of the gaps that are present throughout history. 

What might your map of surviving inscriptions tell us about the way Roman people practiced the “epigraphic habit”? Do you find inscriptions in towns, villas, or on monuments? (You may want to look again at Pleiades to see what sort of ancient sites you’re working with.)
Finally, referring to MacMullen’s article on the “epigraphic habit” in Rome, do you think digital tools like high-res imaging and digital mapping change how historians might interpret the rise and fall of the “epigraphic habit” in Roman society?
