Historians have suggested that alphabetic writing enabled the development of philosophical thought in Greece that was markedly different from that of ancient Mesopotamia, with its cuneiform syllabary. What does this argument suggest about the structure of a language and what that language makes possible? What are the implications of this argument for the way we think about computer languages?

To receive full credit for this assignment, be sure to draw comparisons between the arguments expressed by Goody and Van De Mieroop in their respective articles and those you develop related to digital communications. Use parenthetical citations (lastname page#) to cite these works if necessary.

## Stella's Thoughts

From the two readings, it seems that the language used in ancient Mesopotamia, specifically Babylon and Assur, was used much more for administrative and record-keeping purposes, as evidenced by the various myths and epic poems that have survived in addition to the records of business and laws that have survived. However, this does't mean that the Greeks did anything better, it was merely different.

### MESOPOTAMIA

An example of this comes from the Van De Mieroop reading, where great detail is gone into about how exactly the language works. Specifically, each element of language represents a specific meaning which can be condensed into one word, as seen in the details of Marduk's thirty sixth name, LUGALABDUBUR (Van De Mieroop, 8). What appears to be a name is a complex sentence, a description of what was greatly important to be written down. 

Part of the broader iportance also comes from the goal of the writings. Van De Mieroop details about the differences in the script work between the scholars. It is pointed out that the teachers of the scribes would inscribe portions of text on one side, and the scribes would copy it line for line on the other. This was evidenced by the tablets being signifigantly thinner on one side from the teachers scraping away the clay so the students could begin again (Van De Mieroop, 18). However, it was also incredibly important to keep administrative records along the way, as evidenced in the several tablets we have available like [this](https://cdli.earth/artifacts/102299) one, at Emory University in Georgia. 

It is often seen that the Babylonians, for example, did not have a concrete philosiphy system that they worked through, but this is simply not the case. They simply didn't keep records of it in the same way that others did

### GREECE

The Greeks are famous for their philosiphy, for their waxing poetic about everything under the sun. Initially, they had a similar setup to the Mesopotamians, where there were two simultaneous languages that people were fluent or literate in, but that changed once time moved a little further forward. 

There is the thought that the Greeks were mostly an oratorical bunch, and this seems to be true based on a lot of their traditions regarding various festivals and the like. This is also seen through how some of the authors of various records we have, and their attitudes toward the other histories and thinkers. Specifically, I'll point to one specific historian, referenced in Goody's article, where Hecataeus wrote, "What I write is the account that I believe to be true. For the stories the Greeks tell are many and in my opinion, ridiculous." (322, Goody)



### BOTH?

Both of these civilizations cared deeply about their records. They created libraries, sent for copies of texts they didn't possess, took great care to preserve the texts they already had, and believed that what they already had was a foundation for the rest of their learning.
