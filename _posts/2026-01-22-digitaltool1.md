prompt:

Historians have suggested that alphabetic writing enabled the development of philosophical thought in Greece that was markedly different from that of ancient Mesopotamia, with its cuneiform syllabary. What does this argument suggest about the structure of a language and what that language makes possible? What are the implications of this argument for the way we think about computer languages?

To receive full credit for this assignment, be sure to draw comparisons between the arguments expressed by Goody and Van De Mieroop in their respective articles and those you develop related to digital communications. Use parenthetical citations (lastname page#) to cite these works if necessary.

From the two readings, it seems that the language used in ancient Mesopotamia, specifically Babylon and ___ was used much more for administrative and record-keeping purposes, as evidenced by the various myths and epic poems that have survived in addition to the records of business and laws that have survived.

An example of this comes from the Van De Mieroop reading, where great detail is gone into about how exactly the language works. Specifically, each element of language represents a specific meaning which can be condensed into one word, as seen in the details of Marduk's thirty sixth name, LUGALABDUBUR (8, Van De Mieroop). What appears to be a name is a complex sentence, a description of what was greatly important to be written down.
