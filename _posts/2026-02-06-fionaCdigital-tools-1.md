In this post, I explore how early forms of writing and record-keeping shaped the way societies organized knowledge, and how those ideas connect to modern computer languages and digital communication. I never realized writing was considered a form of technology because, throughout my life, technology has always felt separate from writing—especially anything physical or on paper. Seeing early writing systems like cuneiform framed as tools and innovations, rather than just ordinary parts of daily life, completely shifted my perspective. Writing functioned as a way to store and transmit information, much like how we now use computers, texting, and the internet to communicate and organize knowledge. Thinking about writing this way makes it feel less distant from modern digital tools and more like an early version of them.

One way to understand how writing systems influence society is through Jack Goody’s work, which discusses how literacy shapes social organization and power structures. You can read more about his ideas [here](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Goody).
