# Structure and Possibility of Languages

When discussing the structure of a langauage and what makes language possible we must look to the past. From Cuniform to the written alphabet both brought us different forms of communication but more so brought us to how we understand and use language today. Goody and Watt believe that the written alphabet brought us to a deeper form of thought. Remarking about how people were able to start noticing inconsistencies in stories and beliefs that they had previously never been able to see written down. Only being passed generation to generation orally. They cite this as an example of deeper thought and investegations within a society. Mieroop however suggests that it was cunieforms diverse and bilingual qualities that had the advantage saying "literate creativity can thrive within linguistic heterogeneity" (Meiroop 14) 

I think to fully understand language and its capabilities as we know now, you have to take a mix of these two arguments. I do think the amalgomation of different cultures and how they shapped the structure of language eventually lead to a more cohesive way of communication. Providing a foundation and leading us to think more critically and share our knowledge on a much larger scale than ever achieved previously, through the development of the alphabet. I think the two have to work together for us to truly understand the scope of possibilities that can be achieved through language. 

For more information about this topic I would recommend the [TCU library database][1].
