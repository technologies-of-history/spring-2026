## From Cuneiform to the Alphabet

Historians argue that different structures of writing determine how we as people think. Goody and Watt explain in the text that in oral cultures, people had to remember everything; knowledge depends on traditions and memory, keeping the ideas tied to social situations. The text states that anything you are writing down and saving for the future is something important and worth record-keeping. (Goody and Watt 311-332) A written record society is different because you write it down by making it permanent and easier to look at. It breaks words down into small sound units. Alphabetic writing helps people think clearly, make a logical argument, and compare their own ideas with others, which supported the rise of ancient Greece.

Marc Van De Mieroop talks about how Mesopotamian civilization was developed for different reasons. Cuneiform began as a system for keeping records and running the society. The nature of cuneiform is that every sign has multiple meanings and can be interpreted in different ways depending a lot on context.
