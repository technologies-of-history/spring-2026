## Digital Tools Assignment One
Van De Mieroop and Goody both had views on the structure of language and the way said structure affected the way we thought. Goody stated that the creation of the greek alphabet helped improve thought by making writting more simple to understand. Van De Mieroop was directly opposed to said idea as he had argued "The fundamental difference between Greece and Babylon should not lead to the conclusion that the Babylonian approach was not philosophical or systematic. On the contrary, it was a rigorously disciplined, scientific search for truth."(Van De Mieroop 12#).
The arguments of Van De Mieroop and Goody makes the question "Does an alphabet improve thinking?" come up to mind as their whole arguments are whether alphabets mean one can think more thoroughly. The way these arguments can be applied to coding is simply by considering that coding is a type of language, in which learning commands teaches you how to speak said language.

Having multiple types of coding languages can sort of serve in a "Van De Mieroop vs Goody" type of situation where one person can argue that knowing C+ makes you smarter although complicated and have someone else say that although Python may be simpler, it is more effective as more people are able to learn it and use it.
